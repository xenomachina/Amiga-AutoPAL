AutoPAL is a program I wrote for the Amiga around 1993 - 1995. It's a tool to
automatically promote screens to PAL or NTSC based on various heuristics.

Back when I started writing it I was in high school. I only every released
binaries, which I uploaded to a few BBSes in the Toronto Ontario area. I
remember [Command Line BBS](http://www.amigareport.com/ar120/p2-1-10.html) in
particular was an Amiga BBS I frequented.

Recently, after I mentioned the existence of this tool, someone asked me if it
was on Aminet. I couldn't find it there, but I was able to find the source code
in the backup I made of my Amiga's hard drive. I currently have no way to build
it, but I'm releasing the source, now as GPL.

The old documentation was written in TransWrite. It's mostly readable text, but
I've also included a markdown version.
